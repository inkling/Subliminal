 As a convenience, test writers may specify the device type(s) on which a
 test can run by suffixing tests' names in the following fashion:

 ### Conditionalizing tests and test cases based on tags
 
 The default implementation of this method examines the `SL_TAGS` environment
 variable, which may be set to a comma-separated list of tags like "foo,bar,-baz"
 (_without_ spaces). If the variable is not set, this method will return `YES`.
 If the variable is set, this method will return `YES` if and only if:
 
 * the list contains one or more tags not prefixed with '-', those tags
 [apply to this test case](+tagsForTestCaseWithSelector:), and the list does not
 contain any applicable tags prefixed with '-'; or if
 * the list contains _only_ tags prefixed with '-', and none of those tags
 apply to this test case.
 
 For instance, if `[FooTest testCaseWithSelectorSupportsCurrentEnvironment:@selector(foo)]`
 were called, given the [default tags](+tagsForTestCaseWithSelector:) for `foo`
 ("FooTest", "1", and "foo") and the following values of `SL_TAGS`,
 this method would return:
 
 * (not set) -> `YES`
 * "FooTest" -> `YES` (because `-foo` is tagged with "FooTest")
 * "foo" -> `YES` (because `-foo` is tagged with "foo")
 * "bar" -> `NO` (because `-foo` is not tagged with "bar")
 * "-bar" -> `YES` (because `-foo` is not tagged with "bar")
 * "-bar,baz" -> `NO` (because `-foo` is not tagged with "baz")
 * "-foo" -> `NO` (because `-foo` is tagged with "foo")
 * "FooTest,-foo" -> `NO` (because `-foo` is tagged with "foo", even though it's tagged with "FooTest")
 
 It bears repeating that, by default, test cases inherit their test's [tags](+tags).
 Thus, all test cases of `FooTest` may be "selected" by setting `SL_TAGS` to "FooTest".
 
 @warning If the test does not support the current environment, its cases
 will not be run regardless of this method's return value.
 
 @param testCaseSelector A selector identifying a test case.
 
 @return `YES` if the test case should be run in the current environment, `NO` otherwise.
 
 @see +supportsCurrentEnvironment
 */
+ (BOOL)testCaseWithSelectorSupportsCurrentEnvironment:(SEL)testCaseSelector;

/**
 Returns YES if the test has at least one test case which is focused
 and which supports the current [platform](+testCaseWithSelectorSupportsCurrentPlatform:)
 and [environment](+testCaseWithSelectorSupportsCurrentEnvironment:).

 When a test is run, if any of its test cases are focused, only those test cases will run.
 This may be useful when writing or debugging tests.

 A test case is focused by prefixing its name with "`focus_`", like so:

    - (void)focus_testFoo;

 It is also possible to implicitly focus all test cases by prefixing
 their test's name with "`Focus_`". But if some test cases are explicitly focused
 (as above), only those test cases will run--the narrowest focus applies.

 If a test is focused, that focus will apply to any tests which descend from it.

 @warning Methods that take test case selectors as arguments (like
 `-setUpTestCaseWithSelector:`) are invoked with the unfocused form of the selectors
 --they need not (and should not) be modified when a test case is focused.

 @warning Focused test cases will not be run if their test is not run (e.g. if
 it is not included in the set of tests to be run, or if it does not support
 the current [platform](+supportsCurrentPlatform) or [environment](+supportsCurrentEnvironment)).

#pragma mark - Ordering Test Runs
/// ------------------------------------------
/// @name Ordering Test Runs
/// ------------------------------------------

/**
 Returns a value identifying the group of tests to which the receiver belongs.
 
 `SLTestController` will run tests in ascending order of group, and then within
 each group, in a randomized order. This allows test writers to provide a rough
 order to tests, where necessary, while minimizing the test pollution that can
 result from an absolute ordering.
 
 A common use for run groups is to divide tests into two groups, those that
 need to occur before some "startup" event (an onboarding flow, an import process, etc.)
 (of run group `1`) and those that need to occur afterward (of run group `2`).
 In this scenario, the "post-startup" tests subclass an [abstract test](+isAbstract)
 that, in its implementation of `+setUpTest`, causes the startup event to happen.
 Altogether, this ensures that _all_ of the "pre-startup" tests run before
 _any_ of the "post-startup" tests run--and that startup happens before any of the
 "post-startup" tests happen--while allowing the tests within each group to run
 in any order.

 @return A value identifying the group of tests to which the receiver belongs.
 The default implementation returns `1`: all tests will be part of a single run group.

/**
 The methods in the `SLTest (SLTestCase)` category are used to set up before

 defined on a subclass of SLTest:
 
 * whose names have the prefix "test",

 * which take no arguments.

 When a test is [run](-runAndReportNumExecuted:failed:failedUnexpectedly:),
 it discovers, sets up, runs, and tears down all its test cases.
 The method descriptions below specify when each method will be called,
 and `-[SLTestTests testCompleteTestRunSequence]` gives an example.

 A test case "passes" if it throws no exceptions in its set-up, tear-down, or 
 the body of the test case itself; otherwise, it "fails". That failure is 
 "expected" if it was caused by a test assertion failing. Any other exception
 causes an "unexpected" failure.
