[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inkling/Subliminal.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inkling/Subliminal)

Subliminal is an framework for writing iOS integration tests. Subliminal provides 
a familiar OCUnit/SenTest-like interface to Apple's UIAutomation framework, 
with tests written entirely in Objective-C. Subliminal also provides a powerful 
mechanism for your tests to manipulate your application directly.

Features
--------

#### Seamless Integration

Write your tests in Objective-C, and run them from Xcode. See rich-text logs 
and screenshots in Instruments. Use UIAutomation to simulate user interaction. 
Subliminal lets you use familiar tools, no dependencies required.

#### Full Control

By using UIAutomation, Subliminal can simulate almost any interaction--without 
resorting to private APIs. From navigating in-app purchase dialogs, to putting 
your app to sleep, Subliminal lets you simulate complex interaction like a user. 
And when you want to manipulate your app directly, Subliminal will help you do 
that too.

#### Scalable Tests

Define Objective-C methods to help set up and tear down tests. Leverage native 
support for continuous integration. Take confidence in Subliminal's complete 
documentation and full test coverage. Subliminal is the perfect foundation 
for your tests.

How to Get Started
------------------

* [Download Subliminal](https://github.com/inkling/Subliminal/zipball/master) 
and try out the included example app. Instructions for running the example app are [here](#running-the-example-app)
* Install Subliminal and write your first test in just 10 minutes (guide below, 
screencast [here](https://vimeo.com/67765518))
* Read the FAQ [here](#faq), and find support [@subliminaltest](https://twitter.com/subliminaltest) 
and on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/subliminal)

Running the Example App
-----------------------

1. Clone the Subliminal repo: `git clone git@github.com:inkling/Subliminal.git`
2. cd into the directory: `cd Subliminal`
3. If you haven't already, setup Subliminal: `rake install`
4. Open the Example project: `open Example/SubliminalTest.xcodeproj`
5. Run the tests: Using the `Integration Tests` scheme, choose Product > Profile (âŒ˜+I).
6. Under the User Templates, choose Subliminal

Installing Subliminal
---------------------

###Downloading Subliminal

First, create a directory named `Integration\ Tests` in your project for 
integration tests, and download and add Subliminal to your new directory. If
you're using git for your project add Subliminal as a submodule:

    mkdir Integration\ Tests
    mkdir Integration\ Tests/Subliminal
    git submodule add git@github.com:inkling/Subliminal.git Integration\ Tests/Subliminal/

Otherwise manually download and add Subliminal to your 
`Integration\ Tests/Subliminal` directory.

###Installing supporting files

Now, install Subliminal's supporting files, such as test file templates and 
Subliminal's documentation:

    cd Integration\ Tests/Subliminal
    rake install

If you'd rather read Subliminal's documentation online you can append `DOCS=no` 
to this command.

###Adding Subliminal to your project

Open up your project, and create a group for your integration tests. Use the 
inspector pane to make your new group represent your Integration Tests 
directory. 

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/MakeGroupRepresentIntegrationTests.png)

Next, add Subliminal to your project by dragging its project file into your new
group.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/AddSubliminalToProject.png)

###Creating a target for your integration tests

Creating a separate target for your integration tests will allow you to control
exactly when your tests are run. To begin with, right click your application 
target and select Duplicate.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/CreateTarget.png)

Next, rename both your new target to Integration Tests and the info.plist 
created for it to `Integration Tests-Info.plist`. Move the reference to the 
newly created target's info.plist into your Integration Tests group using the 
navigator pane, and move the actual info.plist file into your 
`Integration Tests` directory using the Finder. After this step you will need to
update Xcode's reference to the plist.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/UpdatePlistReference.png)

Now, link Subliminal to the Integration Tests target. To do this open the 
project inspector by selecting your project in the navigator pane. Then select 
your Integration Tests target and then the Build Phases tab, and add 
`libSubliminal.a` to the list titled Link Binary With Libraries.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/LinkSubliminalBinary.png)

Also add Subliminal to the list of Target Dependencies. This ensures Subliminal 
will be built before your application.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/AddSubliminalDependency.png)

There are a few additional settings to change, however Subliminal can make these
changes for you if you apply its xcconfig to your Integration Tests target. To 
do this expand Subliminal's project reference in your navigator pane, then drag 
the `Integration Tests.xcconfig` file into the base level of your Integration 
Tests group. Now, select your project within the project inspector, navigate to 
the Info tab, and base the configurations used to build your Integration Tests 
target off `Integration Tests.xcconfig`.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/SetConfigurations.png)

Finally, to ensure that this xcconfig file takes effect, you must delete two 
default build settings. Select your Integration Tests target in the project 
inspector and then select the Build Settings tab. Search for and delete the 
settings for Product Name and Info.plist File: these values will be provided by 
the `Integration Tests.xcconfig` file. NOTE: to delete the Info.plist setting, 
you must have renamed and moved your Integration Tests target's info.plist as 
described above.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/DeleteProductNameSetting.png)

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/DeletePlistSetting.png)

###Creating a scheme for your integration tests target

You're going to need to create a new scheme to run your Integration Tests 
target. Click on the name of your active scheme above the navigator pane to open
up the scheme dropdown, and select the Manage Schemes option. Depending on your 
project's settings, some extra schemes may have been created during the 
preceding steps. These schemes can be removed, but be careful not to delete the 
schemes you use regularly.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/DeleteExtraSchemes.png)

Now, add an additional scheme to build the Integration Tests target.

![](http://inkling.github.io/Subliminal/readme-images/CreateIntegrationTestsScheme.png)

###Running Tests on the integration tests target

Finally, you'll need to add some code to you app delegate to tell Subliminal to 
begin running your tests. First build your Integration Tests scheme, so that 
Xcode can provide autocomplete as you modify your app delegate. Then, import the
Subliminal header at the top of your app delegate implementation file:

    #if INTEGRATION_TESTING
    #import <Subliminal/Subliminal.h>
    #endif
    
and tell the shared test controller to run all test cases:

    #if INTEGRATION_TESTING
    [[SLTestController sharedTestController] runTests:[SLTest allTests] withCompletionBlock:nil];
    #endif
   
Note that this code is conditionalized by the INTEGRATION_TESTING preprocessor 
macro set by `Integration Tests.xcconfig`, and will not be built into your main 
application target. Unlike many other integration test frameworks Subliminal 
does not use private APIs, so it is safe to include this call in any target that 
links against Subliminal. However, unless UIAutomation is running it will not do
anything, and thus its cleaner and more efficient to include it only when
integration testing.

Also note that you do not need to direct the test controller to run specific 
tests: Subliminal automatically discovers all tests linked against the 
Integration Tests target.

Usage
-----

Subliminal is designed to be instantly familiar to users of OCUnit/SenTest. 
In Subliminal, subclasses of `SLTest` define tests as methods beginning with "test". 
At run-time, the `SLTestController` discovers and runs these tests. 
Here's what a sample `SLTest` implementation looks like:

	@implementation STLoginTest

	- (void)testLogInSucceedsWithUsernameAndPassword {
		SLTextField *usernameField = [SLTextField elementWithAccessibilityLabel:@"username field"];
		SLTextField *passwordField = [SLTextField elementWithAccessibilityLabel:@"password field" isSecure:YES];
		SLElement *submitButton = [SLElement elementWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Submit"];
		SLElement *loginSpinner = [SLElement elementWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Logging in..."];
		
	    NSString *username = @"Jeff", *password = @"foo";
	    [usernameField setText:username];
	    [UIAElement(passwordField) setText:password];
    
	    [UIAElement(submitButton) tap];
    
    	// wait for the login spinner to disappear
	    SLAssertTrueWithTimeout([UIAElement(_loginSpinner) isInvalidOrInvisible], 
	    						3.0, @"Log-in was not successful.");
    
	    NSString *successMessage = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, %@!", username];
	    SLAssertTrue([UIAElement([SLElement elementWithAccessibilityLabel:successMessage]) isValid], 
	    			@"Log-in did not succeed.");
	}

	@end


In the body of those tests, you do some work and then make some assertions. 
In tests, you can simulate user interaction and even manipulate the application 
directly.

### Simulate User Interaction 

In Subliminal tests, you manipulate the user interface using instances of `SLElement`.
`SLElements` are proxies for the "`UIAElements`" UIAutomation uses to represent 
user interface elements: when you `-tap` an `SLElement`, that `SLElement` causes 
the appropriate bit of JavaScript to be executed to manipulate the corresponding 
`UIAElement`. Tests execute asynchronously, so they can block until `UIAutomation` 
is done evaluating the command.

### Manipulate the Application Directly

Subliminal lets tests access and manipulate application state by using "app hooks". 
Hooks are methods which the application registers with the test controller to 
then be invoked, by name, by the tests. Any arguments or return values of these 
methods are copied between the tests and application.

For instance, before running the tests, the application delegate could register
 a "login manager" singleton as being able to programmatically log a test user in:

     [[SLTestController sharedTestController] registerTarget:[LoginManager sharedManager] 
                                                   forAction:@selector(logInWithInfo:)];
 
 When tests need to log in, they could then call `loginWithInfo:`:
 
    [[SLTestController sharedTestController] sendAction:@selector(logInWithInfo:)
                                             withObject:@{
                                                            @"username": @"john@foo.com",
                                                            @"password": @"Hello1234"
                                                         }];

App hooks help developers write independent, scalable tests: while one test could 
(and should) test logging in as a user would, using the UI, the other tests could
use the programmatic interface, and not be crippled if the log-in UI were to break.

This technique also allows test writers to re-use their application's code without 
making their tests dependent on the application's structure, and without 
sharing state between the application and tests.

Requirements
------------

Subliminal requires iOS 5.0 and above, and has been tested with the latest Xcode 
(4.6.2).

Continuous Integration
----------------------

You can run Subliminal tests from the command-line using the `subliminal-test` 
script, which takes care of building your application and running the tests on the 
appropriate simulator or device.

To use `subliminal-test`, install Subliminal on the test machine as above,
then "share" the "Integration Tests" scheme to make it available to the CI server 
(in Xcode, click "Product" -> "Schemes" -> "Manage Schemesâ€¦", click the "Shared" checkbox 
next to the scheme, and check the resulting file into source control).

A minimal test runner would then look something like this: 

	#!/bin/bash

	# Run the tests in the non-retina iPhone Simulator
	DEVICE="iPhone"

	# A bug in Instruments (http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1544403) 
	# requires that the script be invoked with the current user's login password in order 
	# to run fully un-attended
	PASSWORD="password1234"

	OUTPUT_DIR=test-reports
	mkdir -p OUTPUT_DIR

	# Returns 0 on success, 1 on failure
	# Log output and screenshots will be placed in $OUTPUT_DIR
	"$PROJECT_DIR/Integration Tests/Subliminal/Supporting Files/CI/subliminal-test" \
		-project "$YOUR_PROJECT"
		-sim_device "$DEVICE"
		-login_password "$PASSWORD"
		-output "$OUTPUT_DIR"

For CI servers like [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/), you can process test logs 
into JUnit reports using the `subliminal_uialog_to_junit` script:

	"$PROJECT_DIR/Integration Tests/Subliminal/Supporting Files/CI/subliminal_uialog_to_junit" \
		-i ${OUTPUT_DIR}/Run\ Data/Automation\ Results.plist \
		-o ${OUTPUT_DIR}/junit.xml

Subliminal runs integration tests against itself using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/). 
Take a look at its [configuration file](https://github.com/inkling/Subliminal/blob/master/.travis.yml) 
for an example.

FAQ
---

### Subliminal and other integration test frameworks

* 	How is Subliminal different from other integration test frameworks?

	Most other integration test frameworks fall into two categories: entirely 
	Objective-C based, or entirely UIAutomation-based.

	Frameworks that are entirely Objective-C based, like [KIF](https://github.com/square/KIF/), 
	[Frank](https://github.com/moredip/Frank), etc., must hack the application's 
	touch-handling system, using private APIs, to simulate user interaction. 
	There is thus no guarantee that they accurately simulate a user's input. 
	Moreover, these frameworks can only simulate interaction with the application, 
	as opposed to interaction with the device, other processes like in-app purchase 
	alerts, etc.

	Frameworks that are entirely based on Apple's UIAutomation framework require 
	cumbersome workflows--writing tests in JavaScript, in Instruments--which do not 
	make use of the developer's existing toolchain. Moreover, they offer the developer 
	no means of manipulating the application directly--it is a complete black box 
	to a UIAutomation-based test.

	Only Subliminal combines the convenience and power of writing tests in Objective-C 
	with the reliability of UIAutomation.

* 	How is Subliminal different than UIAutomation?

	Besides the limitations of UIAutomation described above, it is extremely 
	difficult to write UIAutomation tests. This is because UIAutomation requires 
	that user interface elements be identified by their position within the 
	["element hierarchy"](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/UsingtheAutomationInstrument/UsingtheAutomationInstrument.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH20-SW88), like

		UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().mainWindow().tableViews()[0].cells()[0].

	These references not only make tests hard to read, but hard to generate, as
	they require knowledge of the application's view hierarchy--though not _all_ 
	views in the hierarchy appear in such references; UIAutomation has a very 
	particular (you might say arcane) set of rules.

	UIAutomation-based tests are not meant to be written, but to be "recorded" 
	using Instruments. This forces dependence on Instruments, and makes the tests 
	difficult to modify thereafter.

	Subliminal allows developers to identify elements by their properties, 
	independent of their position in the element hierarchy. Subliminal then 
	generates the full reference for the developer.

### Writing and running tests

* 	How do I write a test?

	Very much like you would write a unit test using OCUnit/SenTest: make a new 
	subclass of `SLTest`, and define some "test cases" (methods whose names begin 
	with "test", which take no arguments, and which return void). In those test cases, 
	simulate user interaction or manipulate the application directly, then make 
	some assertions.

	The "Integration test class" file template (in the Xcode "New File" dialog, 
	under "iOS" -> "Subliminal" in the sidebar) stubs out some useful methods. 
	
*	How do I run my application's tests?
	
	1. Switch to your project's "Integration Tests" scheme, whichever device or 
	simulator you like.
	2. Select "Profile" from the "Product" menu (`Cmd-I`).
	3. Choose the "Subliminal" trace template (under "User" -> "All" in the sidebar 
	of the dialog that pops up) .
	
	To re-run the tests when they finish, press "Stop" and then "Record" in 
	Instruments' upper left-hand corner. If you make changes to the tests, 
	you must "push" the changes to Instruments by selecting `Product -> Profile` 
	again.

*	How do I run specific tests?

	By default, Subliminal will run all the test cases (methods beginning with "test") 
	of all the `SLTest` subclasses. You can restrict testing to particular test 
	cases by prefixing their names with "focus_". You can "focus" all test cases 
	of a particular `SLTest` subclass by prefixing its name with "focus_", too. 
	Don't forget to remove the prefixes before committing your changes!
	
### Debugging tests

*	How can I disable UIAutomation's debug logs?

	UIAutomation debug logs record every action taken (`button.tap()`, etc.) 
	and show up in Instruments' trace log. These can sometimes be useful but are mostly noise. 
	Disable them using this command:

		defaults write com.apple.dt.Instruments UIAVerboseLogging -int 4096

	to reset:
		
		defaults delete com.apple.dt.Instruments UIAVerboseLogging

*	How can Subliminal tell me where I'm getting "invalid element" and/or "element not tappable" 
	exceptions?

	Use the `UIAElement` macro to log the filename and line number of calls to 
	`-[SLUIAElement tap]`, etc.:

		[UIAElement(button) tap];

*	How can I debug tests while running?

	You can easily attach the debugger to Instruments, to stop at breakpoints set 
	in Xcode, using the following process:

	1.	Change the build configuration used to profile the "Integration Tests" scheme 
		from "Release" (the default) to "Debug" (in Xcode, click "Product" -> "Schemes" -> 
		"Manage Schemesâ€¦", double-click the "Integration Tests" scheme, select the "Profile" build 
		phase, and then change the build configuration. Otherwise, debug information 
		will be optimized away during build.

		You need not worry that building in "Debug" will cause your tests to not 
		reflect the actual "Release" state of the app--scripts like `subliminal-test` 
		can override the configuration to use "Release" when building the app from the 
		command line.
	
	2.	Launch the tests, then click "Product" -> "Attach to Process" -> (name of the test process, 
		likely "Integration Tests").

		This may be done at any time while the tests are running. If you need 
		to break immediately after launch, you may find it useful to give yourself 
		time to attach the debugger by setting `-[SLTestController shouldWaitToStartTesting]` 
		to `YES`.
