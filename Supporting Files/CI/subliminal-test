subliminal-test (-project <project_path> | -workspace <workspace_path>) 
		( -sim_device <device_type> | -hw_id <udid> )
		(-login_password <password> | --live)
		[-build_tool <tool_name>] [-scheme <scheme_name>] [-sdk <sdk>] [-replacement_bundle_id <id>] [--quiet_build]

\`subliminal-test\` builds a scheme contained in an Xcode project or Xcode workspace,
then tests the product using Subliminal.

\`subliminal-test\` returns failure (non-0) if:

  * the tests did not finish
  * the tests ran in a focused state (see \`+[SLTest isFocused]\`), because then only a subset of tests may have run
  * one or more tests failed

Otherwise, it returns success (0).

\`subliminal-test\` expects to be run:

  * alongside the other scripts that were originally in \`/Supporting Files/CI\`, and
  * with Subliminal having been installed on the test machine, using \`rake install DOCS=no\`.

Also make sure that your \"Integration Tests\" scheme is shared (in Xcode, click \`Product -> Schemes -> Manage Schemes…\`
and then click the \"Shared\" checkbox next to the scheme) and checked into source control:
the server will not be able to autocreate the scheme, as you may have done locally.

Required arguments:
	-project <project_path>		Build the project at the specified path.
					Either this or \`-workspace\` must be specified.

	-workspace <workspace_path>	Build the workspace at the specified path.
					Either this or \`-project\` must be specified.

	-sim_device <device_type>	The type of device to simulate.
					Acceptable values are listed in the iPhone Simulator's \"Hardware -> Device\" menu.
					Either this or \`-hw_id\` must be specified.

	-hw_id <udid>			The UDID of the hardware to target.
					Either this or \`-sim_device\` must be specified.

	-login_password <password>	The current user's login password. When instruments is launched, it may ask 
					for permission to take control of your application (http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1544403). 
					To authorize instruments during an un-attended run, this script requires the current user's password.
					When running this script live, \`--live\` may be specified instead.

	--live				Indicates that this script is being attended by a developer who can 
					enter their password if instruments asks for authorization. For this script 
					to run un-attended, the current user's login password must be specified
					using \`-login_password\`.

Optional build arguments:
	-build_tool <tool_name>		The tool to use to build the scheme. Should be either \"xcrun xcodebuild\" 
					or \"xctool\". Defaults to \"xcrun xcodebuild\".

	-scheme <scheme_name>		The scheme to use to build the specified project or workspace.
					Defaults to \"Integration Tests\".

	-configuration <configuration>	The configuration to use to build the target specified by \`-scheme\`.
					Defaults to \"Release\".

	-sdk <sdk>			The SDK to use to build the specified project or workspace.
					This should be an iPhone Simulator SDK if \`-sim_device\` is specified, 
					or an iOS device SDK if \`-hw_id\` is specified. Defaults to \"iphonesimulator\" 
					(the latest iPhone Simulator SDK) if \`-sim_device\` is specified, 
					or \"iphoneos\" (the latest iOS device SDK) if \`-hw_id\` is specified.

	-replacement_bundle_id <id>	The identifier to use to overwrite the product's bundle identifier.
					When testing in-app purchase, this must be the identifier of your main app.
					
					This option should only be used when testing in the Simulator,
					because two applications with the same identifier cannot be installed simultaneously, 
					and devices cannot be programmatically reset. If this is set and tests are running 
					in the Simulator, the Simulator will be reset after testing 
					to avoid collisions on subsequent runs.

	--quiet_build			If specified, the script will only log build output to the console 
					if the build fails. Builds may be made less verbose, without hiding 
					log output entirely, by using \`xctool\` as a build tool.

Optional testing arguments:
	-timeout <timeout>		The maximum duration for which to run the tests before aborting.
					Specified in milliseconds and as a number rather than a string. Defaults to infinite.

	-output <output_dir>		The directory to which to save Instruments' output, to aid in debugging test failures:
					  * the run log, as an XML plist;
					  * screenshots taken when warnings or errors are logged;
					  * and the run's .trace file, which can be opened in the Instruments GUI to view the run log and the screenshots.
					Has no default value.

	-e <variable> <value>		An environment variable setting. You may specify more than one.
